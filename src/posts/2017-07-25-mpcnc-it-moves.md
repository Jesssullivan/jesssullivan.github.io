These are some photos of the current [MPCNC](https://www.vicious1.com/information/) project coming alive in the Sulliwood basement. The MPCNC is a (relatively) low cost, 3d printed CNC (computer numerical control=does stuff by itself)- featured here is the spindle (actually a drywall cutter) and a mashup mk8-style extruder. Below, you can see what I see before it is cutting time in the CAM module of Fusion 360. That object is half of a "trial run" pottery stand for someone's art show....

Patchwork MPCNC extruder and hot end...

*What was once an image here is now just a memory of a URL.*

Double-sided MPCNC gcode, just for the holder part.....

...For this design:

*The bits that made up this image have scattered to the wind.*
