_A spur-of-the moment turkey thermometer with dubious accuracy, questionable code and unhelpful complexity made of random gahbage._

Uses Steinhart-Hart equation to estimate the temperature from the 8266’s analog pin (this board has a single channel 10 bit ADC) produced by a 100k 104GT-2/104NT-4 thermistor using 10k pullup resistor. The ESP 8266 serves a real-time temperature readout via a websocket connection over the local network. Find this ridiculous project of mine on Github here: https://github.com/Jesssullivan/turkeyprobe
