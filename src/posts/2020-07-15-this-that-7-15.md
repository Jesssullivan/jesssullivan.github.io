**_Bits & bobs, this & that of late:_**

...In effort to thwart the recent heat and humidity here in the White Mountains (or, perhaps just to follow the philosophy of circuitous overcomplication... 🙂 ) here are some sketches of quick-release exhaust fittings of mine for a large, wheeled AC & dehumidifier unit (these have been installed throughout my home via window panels).

...Also, Ryan [@ V1Engineering](https://www.v1engineering.com/) recently released his [new MPCNC Primo here](https://www.v1engineering.com/mpcnc-primo-is-live/), should anyone be keen. Long Live the MPCNC! 🙂

...A really short morning metal:
