**Guitar Practice:**

Laundry is best done early in the morning. The resulting time between cycles lets me do all kinds of things- below is a short guitar "shred" song inspired by Jeff Beck's most recent album, Loud Hailer- recorded in its entirety between washing and drying. I recommend turning your volume down, modesty is not part if this song's vocabulary.
