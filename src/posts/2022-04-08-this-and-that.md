_Letsee...._

  * It's almost springtime in Ithaca!
  * Superduper excited to be hopping over to the Department of Landscape Architecture to explore and expand the [DLA Makerspace at Cornell](https://cals.cornell.edu/landscape-architecture/facilities-resources/fabrication-laboratory)!
  * I have been busy building out the [new Ithaca Generator website](https://ithacagenerator.org/), as well as new member mangegment & accounting software. I've taken over as IG's 3D Printer Area Captain too! 😸
