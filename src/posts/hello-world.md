# Hello World

I'm back. After spending about a year completely offline — no LinkedIn, no blog, no social media — I'm rebuilding my digital presence.

This blog is built with [SvelteKit 5](https://kit.svelte.dev/), [Skeleton UI](https://www.skeleton.dev/) (Pine theme), and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). The old WordPress content from transscendsurvival.org is being migrated over.

More posts coming soon as I migrate the archive and write new content.
