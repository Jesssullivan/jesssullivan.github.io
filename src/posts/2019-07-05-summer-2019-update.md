**GIS Updates:**

Newish Raster / DEM image → STL tool in the Shiny-Apps repo:

**CAD / CAM Updates:**

Been revamping my CNC thoughts- 

Basically, the next move is a complete rebuild (primarily for 6061 aluminum).

I am aiming for:

  * Marlin 2.x.x around either a full-Rambo or 32 bit Archim 1.0 ([https://ultimachine.com/](https://ultimachine.com/)) 
  * Dual endstop configuration, CNC only (no hotend support)
  * 500mm2 work area / swappable spoiler boards (~700mm exterior MPCNC conduit length)
  * Continuous compressed air chip clearing, shop vac / cyclone chip removal
  * Two chamber, full acoustic enclosure (cutting space + air I/O for vac and compressor)
  * Full octoprint networking via GPIO relays

**FWIW** : Sketchup MPCNC:

Also TinkerCAD version:

**Electric Drivetrain Development:**

BORGI / Axial Flux stuff:

Designed some rough coil winders for motor design here:

Also, an itty-bitty, skate bearing-scale axial flux / 3-phase motor to hack upon:
