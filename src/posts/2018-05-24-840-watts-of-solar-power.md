Equipment used:

[Inverter/PWM Controller: http://a.co/fdl9YzI](http://a.co/fdl9YzI)

[2x 35ah Batteries: http://a.co/5JBIxTC](http://a.co/5JBIxTC)

[100w solar panel: http://a.co/5JBIxTC](http://a.co/5JBIxTC)

We need power! While doing bird research in the wilds of northern NH, it became evident we needed electricity to power computers, big cameras, and phones/GPS units.

Below is a table of the system and our expected electricity needs:

System | Solar 100w | 35ah universal (x2) |  |   
---|---|---|---|---  
Ah per day: | 33.33333333 | 35 | TOTAL Ah Reserve: | 70  
V | 12 | 12 | Parallel wiring: | 12v  
Wh in: | 400 | 420 | TOTAL Wh Reserve: | 840  
W | 100 |  |  |   
Cost | $105.00 | $64.00 |  |   
ah/$ |  | 2 |  |   
Sun Hour / Multiplier | 4 | 2 |  |   
Need/Day | Wh | multiplier | consump. in Wh = | 259.36  
Computer | 100 | 2.5 | 250 |   
iPhone | 1.7 | 2 | 3.4 |   
AAs | 11.2 | 0.3 | 3.36 |   
Camera | 2.6 | 1 | 2.6 |   
  
***The milk crate system below can charge a 100 watt MacBook Pro around 8-9 times from being completely empty.**

****Remember: V*A=W, W/V=A, and Watts over time is Wh.**

+/- relates to size of standard prongs

Parallel maintains 12v but doubles Ah. (Series would go to 24v at 35ah)
