Written in R; using GDAL/EXPAT libraries on Ubuntu and hosted with AWS EC2.

**New App: KML Search and Convert**

Here is an simple (beta) app of mine that converts KML files into Excel-friendly CSV documents. It also has a search function, so you can download a subset of data that contains keywords. 🙂

The files will soon be available in Github.

I'm still working on a progress indicator; it currently lets you download before it is done processing. Know a completely processed file is titled with "kml2csv_&lt;yourfile>.csv".

...YMMV. xD
