Check out this project here: https://tetrahedron.gay/

Tetrahedron.gay is a mutual aid mental health group informally continuing the structured partial hospitalization Triangle Program. I wrote this intake / project page in SvelteKit; feel welcome to take a look through the [code here on github](https://github.com/Jesssullivan/tetrahedron/tree/main/app) if you are curious- PRs welcome.

There are a few goals of this experimental humanitarian project:  – recreate the structure group therapy offers; to do this, we host a daily wakeup call at ~8:30 every day via Discord. Any member with the ‘wakeup-call’ discord roll is empowered to initiate, join and call (and- if needed- delegate further wakeup calls, via an means necessary- phone call, discord, email, DMs, doordash coffee delivery to your peer, knock on their door, call their neighbors etc) . I intend to write a utility to automate wakeup phone calls and allow users to securely wake each other up without having their personal info (phone #, address etc).

– recreate and extend the social and interpersonal aspects of a group therapy program through in-person activities as well as virtual, peer led group sessions

– experiment with horizontal organization structures with minimal hierarchical organization in a traditionally stratified space; enable the trusting reliance of individuals to guide group moderation, while protecting personal info. To do this, function group size is to be limited at 13 individuals (wakeup call groups, digital and in-person group sessions). Additional function groups are to be spawned and destroyed as needed; this group size limit is to be reflected across Tetrahedron.gay projects.
