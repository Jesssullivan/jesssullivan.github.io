Joplin for all your Operating Systems and devices

As a lifelong IOS + OSX user (Apple products), I have used many, many notes apps over the years. From big name apps like OmniFocus, Things 3, Notes+, to all the usual suspects like Trello, Notability, Notemaster, RTM, and others, I always eventually migrate back to Apple notes, simply because it is always available and always up to date. There are zero “features” besides this convenience, which is why I am perpetually willing to give a new app a spin.

Joplin is free, open source, and works on OSX, Windows, Linux operating systems and IOS and Android phones.

Find it here:

`brew install joplin`

The most important thing this project has nailed is cloud support and syncing. I have my iPhone and computers syncing via Dropbox, which is easy to setup and works…. really well. Joplin folks have added many cloud options, so this is unlikely to be a sticking point for users.

Here are some of the key features:

  * Markdown is totally supported for straightforward and easy formatting
  * External editor support for emacs / atom / etc folks
    * Extra bit to troubleshoot possible issue for hardcore emacs users:
    * [https://discourse.joplin.cozic.net/t/note-for-emacs-users/623](https://discourse.joplin.cozic.net/t/note-for-emacs-users/623)
  * Layout is clean, uncluttered, and just makes sense
  * Built-in markdown text editor and viewer is great
  * Notebook, todo, note, and tags work great across platforms
  * Browser integration, E2EE security, file attachments, and geolocation included

Hopefully this will be helpful.

Cheers,
