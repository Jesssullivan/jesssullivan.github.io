Well. There comes a time when one remembering [the right things at the right time equates to a high-stakes venture in academia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Final_examination).

Below is a gallery of photos taken today, comprised almost entirely out of bark, leaves, and twigs. This is my study guide for the upcoming natural history final exam. It is not near complete; but for a walk through the woods and a significant number of hours behind a camera, computer, and coffee cup, I think it will do for now. Frogs, tracks, and birds are not covered here.
