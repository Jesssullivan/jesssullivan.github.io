_Note: SMB / SharePoint is surely better with a proper server/computer. A Raspberry Pi running OpenMediaVault (Debian) is a more common and robust option (still 5v low power)._

_If you are actually in an "it must done in OpenWRT" scenario, Click Here for my Samba config file:*the config file download, once hosted on WordPress, is no longer available* and see below. Also, please use a NTFS or EX4 format. 🙂_
