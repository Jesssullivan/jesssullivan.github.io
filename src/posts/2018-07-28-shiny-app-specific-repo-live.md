**New Shiny App specific Repo now live...**

https://github.com/Jesssullivan/Shiny-Apps***This space once held an image. The WordPress CDN has since gone quiet.***

With KML Search and Convert now fully functional (along with the tiny app "clean") , live shiny apps of mine now have a repo of their own. Check it out!*Image from the original post is no longer available -- nothing on the internet is forever.*

*This image has been lost to time. The original was hosted on WordPress.*
