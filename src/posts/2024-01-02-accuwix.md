I wrote this lil command line application while riding on a bus to and from New York City- find the project repository here at [jesssullivan/AccuWixReport](https://github.com/Jesssullivan/AccuWixReport/tree/main). 😸 

This utility generates a variety of concise, merged monthly financial superlative reports in raw markdown, drawing from transaction CSVs exported by Acuity and Wix. 

  * **“Paid” transaction reports** are marked as “paid” by the respective platforms (automatically via credit card or manually upon receiving otherwise untracked currency)
  * **“Unpaid” transaction reports** were _not explicitly_ marked as “paid”; while the most likely scenario is that this transaction was **completed successfully** offline (via cash / venmo), an “Unpaid” status may imply the client did not settle up or the transaction was recorded erroneously due to cancellation, revision or other extenuating circumstances.

### Intended usage:

_Setup:_
    
    
    python3.12 -m venv accuwix_venv
    source accuwix_venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt

_Generate and print report for January:_
    
    
     python3 src/cmdline.py -m Jan

_Generate and save all reports to markdown file:_
    
    
     python3 src/cmdline.py -all > AccuWixReport.md

_Generate a sexy PDF report from markdown file:_
    
    
    pandoc AccuWixReport.md -o output.pdf -V geometry:margin=1in
