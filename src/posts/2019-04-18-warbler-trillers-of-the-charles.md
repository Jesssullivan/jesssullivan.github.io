The first ones to arrive in MA, brush up!

**Palm warbler**

[songs](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Palm_Warbler/sounds)

This is usually the first one to arrive. Gold bird, medium sized warbler, rufus hat. When they arrive in MA they are often found lower than usual / on the ground looking for anything they can munch on. Song is a rapid trill. More “musical / pleasant” than a fast chipping sparrow, faster than many Junco trills.

**Pine warbler**

[songs](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Pine_Warbler/sounds)

Slimmer than palm, no hat, very slim beak, has streaks on the breast usually. Also a triller. They remain higher in the trees on arrival.

**Yellow-rumped warbler**

[songs](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Yellow-rumped_Warbler/sounds)

Spectacular bird, if it has arrived you can’t miss it- also they will arrive by the dozen so worth waiting for a good visual. These also trill, which is another reason it is good to get a visual. The trill is slow, very “sing-song”, and has a downward inflection at the end. If there are a bunch sticking around for the summer, try to watch some sing- soon enough you will be able to pick out this trill from the others.

-- [Yellow warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Yellow_Warbler/id) says “sweet sweet sweet, I’m so Sweet!” and can get a bit confusing with Yellow-rumped warbler

-- [Chestnut-sided warbler](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Chestnut-sided_Warbler/id) says “very very pleased to meet ya!” and can get a bit confusing with Yellow warbler

**Black-and-white warbler**

[songs](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Black-and-white_Warbler/sounds)

Looks like a zebra - always acts like a nuthatch (clings to trunk and branches). This one trills like a rusty wheel. It can easily be distinguished after a bit of birding with some around.

**American Redstart**

[songs](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/American_Redstart/sounds)

Adult males look like a late 50’s hot-rodded American muscle car: long, low, two tone paint job. Matte/luster black with flame accents. Can’t miss it. The females and young males are buff (chrome, to keep in style I guess) with yellow accents. Look for behavior- if a “female” is getting beaten up while trying to sing a song in the same area, it is actually a first year male failing to establish a territory due to obviously being a youth.

Cheers,
