While somewhat of a historical entry:

Below are some of the few photos I took while birding on may 5, 2018- GLOBAL BIG DAY! Be sure to read about it here: https://ebird.org/news/global-big-day-5-may-2018

Myself and my father contributed 64 species, including the below Northern waterthrush, Female Rose-breasted Grosbeak, Northern Parula, and Common Yellowthroat warbler.
